A project to replicate Google's homepage! This is a challenge from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) from when I was working through the Foundations path. 

The aim of the project is to just build and replicate Google's homepage as best I can using HTML and CSS. It will not have the greatest functionality, but the general target was to create a like for like appearance and to start using HTML and CSS, with the use of DevTools and Git.

##### Key takeaways:

- I was really impressed with what I was able to create after a long time away using HTML and CSS.
- I am most proud of the footer and how realistic it looks. Generally speaking, I wanted consistency in the choice of font, font sizes, colours and so on to get a "good enough" replication of the page. DevTools was super handy for this. It's incredibly useful in exploring the elements and styles of a webpage, so it proved to be quite handy for replication purposes.
- There was a lot of fun (and frustration) trying to get the alignment just right. Notably, it is the logo and the Google icons that caused some trouble but have since learnt a great deal overcoming this with CSS Flex and Grid! 
- Looking back it isn't at all that responsive on different device widths so I'd like to revisit this and address it at a later time.
