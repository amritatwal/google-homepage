A project to replicate Google's homepage! This is a challenge from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) when I was working through the Foundations path. 

The aim of the project is to just build and replicate Google's homepage as best I can using HTML and CSS. It will not have the greatest functionality, but the general target was to create a like for like appearance and to start using HTML and CSS, with the use of DevTools and Git.
